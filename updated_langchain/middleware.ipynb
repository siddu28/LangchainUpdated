Let me recall the basic multiplication rules. Multiplying by 100 is straightforward because it's a power of 10. When you multiply a number by 100, you just add two zeros to the end of that number. So 5 times 100 would be 500. Wait, but the user wrote 100*5, which is the same as 5*100 due to the commutative property. Yeah, multiplication is commutative, so the order doesn't matter. So regardless, 100 multiplied by 5 is 500. Let me double-check that. 100 times 5 is like adding 100 five times: 100 + 100 + 100 + 100 + 100. That's 500. Yep, that's correct. Maybe the user is testing my basic math skills or just needs a quick answer. Either way, the answer is clearly 500.

Even though the previous responses were identical, the user might expect the same format here. The AI\\'s observation about the repetition might be noted, but the user hasn\\'t mentioned any issues, so just proceed with the function call.\\n\\nI\\'ll generate the tool_call with the city set to Dubai.
