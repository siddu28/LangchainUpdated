Hmm, so division is about splitting a number into equal parts. If I have 100 and I want to divide it into 4 equal parts, how much is each part?\\n\\nFirst, I can recall that multiplying 4 by 25 gives 100 because 4 times 25 is 100. Let me check that: 4*25 = 100. Yes, that's right. So if I divide 100 by 4, each part should be 25. Another way to think about it is breaking down 100 into groups of 4. How many groups of 4 are in 100? Well, 4 goes into 10 twice with a remainder of 2, then bring down the next 0 to make 20. 4 goes into 20 five times. So putting that together, it's 25. \\n\\nAlternatively, using long division: 4 into 10 (the first two digits of 100) is 2 (since 4*2=8). Subtract 8 from 10, you get 2. Bring down the next 0 to make 20. 4 into 20 is 5. So the answer is 25. \\n\\nI can also verify this by multiplying the result by the divisor. 25*4 = 100, which matches the original dividend. That checks out. So yes, 100 divided by 4 is definitely 25. No other possible answers here unless there's some context like modulus, but the question is straightforward. So the final answer is 25.\\n</think>\\n\\nThe result of dividing 100 by 4 is **25**. \\n\\nThis is calculated by determining how many times 4 fits into 100 evenly.

Yes, that's right. So if I divide 100 by 4, each part should be 25. Another way to think about it is breaking down 100 into groups of 4. How many groups of 4 are in 100?

Let\\'s break it down step by step.\\n\\nFirst, basic arithmetic. 2 plus 2. In elementary math, addition is one of the first operations taught. So, 2 + 2 would be combining two quantities of two. If I have two apples and add two more apples, that\\'s four apples. So the answer should be 4. But wait, maybe there\\'s a trick here? Sometimes people ask this question as a joke or to check if someone is paying attention. But in standard mathematics, 2+2 is definitely 4.\\n\\nIs there any context where 2+2 isn\\'t 4? Well, in some non-standard arithmetic systems or in certain bases, maybe. For example, in base 3, the number 2 is still 2, but adding 2+2 would be 11 in base 3, which is 4 in decimal. But the question doesn\\'t specify a base, so it\\'s safe to assume base 10, which is standard. Also, in modular arithmetic, like modulo 3, 2+2 would be 1, but again, unless specified, standard arithmetic applies.\\n\\nAnother angle: sometimes people use \"2+2\" metaphorically or in riddles. For example, in George Orwell\\'s \"1984,\" the Party claims that 2+2=5 as a demonstration of their power to alter reality. But the user didn\\'t mention any political context, so probably not relevant here.\\n\\nLet me check if there\\'s any cultural or linguistic nuance. In some languages, numbers might be represented differently, but the numerical value remains the same. For example, in Chinese, \"two\" is \"二\" and \"four\" is \"四\", but 二 + 二 still equals 四. So the numerical answer remains 4 regardless of language.\\n\\nWhat about units? If it\\'s 2 liters plus 2 liters, it\\'s 4 liters. If it\\'s 2 meters plus 2 meters, 4 meters. The units don\\'t affect the arithmetic here. So unless there\\'s a unit conversion involved, which isn\\'t indicated, the answer is 4.\\n\\nWait, could there be a typo in the question? Like, maybe they meant 2*2 or 2^2? But the question clearly states 2+2. So multiplication or exponentiation isn\\'t the case here.\\n\\nIn summary, under standard arithmetic in base 10, 2 + 2 equals 4. There\\'s no indication of any special context, so the answer should be straightforward. I think that\\'s it.

Wait, looking at the messages list again:\\n\\nThe messages list is:\\n\\n- HumanMessage: 2+2?\\n- AIMessage: 4\\n- HumanMessage: 10*5\\n- AIMessage: 50\\n- HumanMessage: 100/4\\n- AIMessage: 25\\n- HumanMessage: 100*5\\n\\nSo the last message is the user\\'s question without an AI response. Therefore, when extracting context, we need to include all the previous Q&A pairs but note that the last question is pending an answer. However, the instructions say to extract the most important information for the overall goal. Since the user is asking for context to overwrite the history, we need to capture the existing Q&A pairs and the fact that the last question hasn\\'t been answered yet.\\n\\nBut the user\\'s instruction says \"overwritten with the context you extract in this step\". So the extracted context should replace the entire conversation history. Therefore, we need to include all the previous questions and answers, and the last question that hasn\\'t been answered. The important part is the history of math problems and their solutions, showing a pattern. The AI\\'s detailed thinking in each response might be too lengthy, but the user wants the highest quality/relevant info. So the key is to list each question and its answer concisely.\\n\\nTherefore, the extracted context should be a list of the math problems and their answers, along with the last unanswered question. That way, the model can refer back to the previous answers when addressing the next question. The detailed reasoning in the AI\\'s responses isn\\'t needed in the context unless it\\'s crucial, but since the user wants the most important info, the Q&A pairs are sufficient.\\n</think>\\n\\nwhat is 2+2?  \\nAIMessage: The sum of 2 and 2 is **4**.  \\n\\nwhat is 10*5  \\nAIMessage: The product of 10 and 5 is **50**.  \\n\\nwhat is 100/4  \\nAIMessage: The result of dividing 100 by 4 is **25**.  \\n\\nwhat is 100*5', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id='dd761d78-2767-4165-97af-85c7fadee8a6'), AIMessage(content=\"<think>\\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking for 100 multiplied by 5. Hmm, multiplication is a basic arithmetic operation. So 100 times 5. Well, 100 is a round number, so multiplying by 5 should be straightforward. Let me think: 100 times 1 is 100, times 2 is 200, times 3 is 300, times 4 is 400, so times 5 would be 500. Wait, is that right?\\n\\nAlternatively, I can break it down. 100 times 5 is the same as adding 100 five times. So 100 + 100 is 200, plus another 100 is 300, plus another 100 is 400, and finally 500. Yeah, that checks out. Another way is to remember that multiplying by 100 is just adding two zeros. But here it's multiplying by 5. Wait, 5 is half of 10. So 100 times 10 is 1000, so half of that is 500. That makes sense too.\\n\\nI should also consider if there's any trick or shortcut. Since 100 is 10 squared, multiplying by 5 could relate to scaling. But maybe that's complicating it. The user probably wants a straightforward answer. Let me just confirm once more. 5 times 100 is indeed 500. I don't see any errors in that reasoning.\\n\\nSo the answer should be 500. The user has been asking similar simple math problems before, like 2+2, 10*5, 100/4, so this is just continuing the pattern. They might be testing if I can handle basic arithmetic or maybe preparing for something like a quiz. Either way, the answer is clear. I'll state it confidently.\\n</think>\\n\\nThe product of 100 and 5 is **500**. \\n\\nMultiplying 100 by 5 means adding 100 five times (100 + 100 + 100 + 100 + 100), which results in 500.

Let me think about how to approach this. They've been asking basic arithmetic questions like 2+2, 10*5, 100/4, and 100*5. Each time, I provided the answer with a brief explanation. Now they're moving to 105 divided by 5. \\n\\nFirst, I need to confirm the correct answer. Dividing 105 by 5. Let me do the calculation. 5 times 20 is 100, so 5 times 21 would be 105. So 105 divided by 5 is 21. That seems right.\\n\\nWait, maybe I should break it down step by step for clarity. Let's see: 5 goes into 10 twice, so 2. Then bring down the 5, making 15. 5 goes into 15 three times. So 21. Yeah, that's correct. \\n\\nI should explain the process so the user understands. Maybe mention the long division steps. But since the user has been getting straightforward answers, maybe keep it simple. Just state the answer and verify by multiplying 21 by 5 to get 105. \\n\\nAlso, check if there's any possibility of a remainder, but 5 times 21 is exactly 105, so no remainder. The user might be testing if I know division with larger numbers or checking for consistency. \\n\\nI should make sure the explanation is clear but concise. Since the previous answers were direct, I'll follow the same structure: state the answer and confirm with multiplication. \\n\\nSo the answer is 21. Multiply 21 by 5 to get 105. Yep, that works. Alright, ready to respond.\\n</think>\\n\\nThe result of dividing 105 by 5 is **21**. \\n\\nThis is verified by multiplying $ 5 \\\\times 21 = 105 $, confirming the division $ 105 \\\\div 5 = 21 $ is correct. \\n\\n**Answer:** 21.\", additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 463, 'prompt_tokens': 399, 'total_tokens': 862, 'completion_time': 0.904593827, 'completion_tokens_details': None, 'prompt_time': 0.016192445, 'prompt_tokens_details': None, 'queue_time': 0.158822155, 'total_time': 0.920786272}, 'model_name': 'qwen/qwen3-32b', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_2bfcc54d36', 'service_tier': 'on_demand', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None, 'model_provider': 'groq'}, id='lc_run--019b463a-126b-7df2-ae6c-9cee91c8029a-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 399, 'output_tokens': 463, 'total_tokens': 862}), HumanMessage(content='what is 10%5', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id='4689b918-7e86-4dc0-96b9-f2b979bf19a8'), AIMessage(content='<think>\\nOkay, let\\'s see. The user is asking \"what is 10%5\". Hmm, the % symbol here is the modulo operator, right? So they want the remainder when 10 is divided by 5.\\n\\nFirst, I need to recall how modulo works. When you divide 10 by 5, the quotient is 2 and the remainder is 0 because 5 times 2 is exactly 10. So 10 divided by 5 leaves no remainder. Therefore, 10%5 should be 0.\\n\\nWait, let me double-check. If I divide 10 by 5, 5 goes into 10 two times exactly, so there\\'s no remainder. Yes, that\\'s correct. The modulo operation gives the remainder after division. So in this case, the remainder is 0. \\n\\nThe user\\'s previous questions were all basic arithmetic: addition, multiplication, division. Now they\\'re moving to modulo. Since they\\'ve been asking for straightforward answers, I should present the answer clearly and confirm it with a simple calculation. Maybe also mention that modulo gives the remainder, just to explain why the answer is 0. \\n\\nI should structure the response with a clear statement of the answer and then a brief explanation. Let me make sure there\\'s no confusion. For example, if someone isn\\'t familiar with modulo, they might think it\\'s a percentage, but in programming and math, % is modulo. So clarifying that might help. \\n\\nSo the steps are: 10 divided by 5 is 2 with 0 remainder. Hence, 10%5 equals 0. Confirm by multiplying 5*2=10, which leaves no remainder. Yep, that\\'s solid. \\n\\nNo need for complicated explanations here. The user seems to be practicing basic operations, so keeping it simple is key. Just the answer and a quick verification.\\n</think>\\n\\nThe result of $ 10 \\\\mod 5 $ is **0**.  \\n\\nThis is because 5 divides into 10 exactly 2 times (5 × 2 = 10), leaving no remainder.  \\n\\n**Answer:** 0.', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 448, 'prompt_tokens': 1198, 'total_tokens': 1646, 'completion_time': 0.895874774, 'completion_tokens_details': None, 'prompt_time': 0.048461162, 'prompt_tokens_details': None, 'queue_time': 0.056560908, 'total_time': 0.944335936}, 'model_name': 'qwen/qwen3-32b', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_5cf921caa2', 'service_tier': 'on_demand', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None, 'model_provider': 'groq'}, id='lc_run--019b463a-212f-7812-9238-f3c5b728cbb0-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 1198, 'output_tokens': 448, 'total_tokens': 1646})]}\n",
